# TIC_TAC_TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, X or O. The objective is to be the first to align three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares are filled without any player achieving this, the game is declared a draw.
